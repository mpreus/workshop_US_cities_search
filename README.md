# workshop_US_cities_search
The internet site enables you to search the US cities and states by entering first letters of their names.
The page makes the search easy because usually it is enough to enter two or three letters to get reasonable data.
So you may know the proper name of the city, the state where it is located and the population of the city.

This simple project was developed with a little help of Wes Bos tutorial within his 30-day JavaScript challenge. The main aim of this job is to improve and demonstrate my JavaScript (including ES6) skills.
